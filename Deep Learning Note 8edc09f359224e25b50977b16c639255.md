CNN convolutional neural network

In short words, CNN contains several parts: convolution, pooling, MLP

Image convolution operation

Performs a element-wise multiplication and summation between the image matrix and the filter matrix which result in a new matrix.

It is used to detect certain edge in an image

<aside>
💡 Whenever you're given two long lists of numbers and you want to take their convolution

<aside>
1️⃣ Compute the fast fourier transform of each one of them. Treat them like they're the coefficients of a polynomial.

</aside>

<aside>
2️⃣ Then, multiply together the two results that you just got, point wise.

</aside>

<aside>
3️⃣ Then do an inverse fast fourier transform. it only involves O of N log N operations.
